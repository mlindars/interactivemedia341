<em> your </em> <br> 
  art is not about how many people like <br>
<em>your</em> <br> 
  work your art is about if <br>
<em>your</em> <br>
  heart likes your work if your soul likes <br>
<em>your</em> <br>
  work it's about how honest you are with <br>
<em>yourself</em> <br>
and <em>you</em> must never trade honesty for relatability
