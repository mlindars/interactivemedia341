    <br> your <br> 
    art is not about how many people like 
    <br> your <br> 
    work 
    <br> your <br> 
    art is about if 
    <br> your <br> 
    heart likes 
    <br> your <br> 
    work if 
    <br> your <br> 
    soul likes 
    <br> your <br> 
    work it's about how honest 
    <br> you <br> 
    are with 
    <br> yourself <br> 
    and  
    <br> you <br> 
    must never trade honesty for relatability
